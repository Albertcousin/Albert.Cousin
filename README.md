# What is this GitHub about?
The notebooks presented in this repository are some of the projects I have done during my studies.
They are chronological and showcase my progress over that period.
Each notebook contains a Markdown type description at the beginning.
Some notebooks on time-series analysis, modeling, and forecasting are not included on this github.

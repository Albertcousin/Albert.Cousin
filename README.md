# What is this GitHub about?
The notebooks presented in this repository are some of the projects I have done over the past year.
They are chronological and showcase my progress over that period.
Each notebook contains a Markdown type description at the beginning.

EDIT: my most recent and advanced projects are not yet published on this repo but I would gladly present them in an interview. 
They mostly include time-series analysis, statistical tests, modeling, and forecasting.
